/* Pendulum Environment:
 *
 * The environment consists of single pendulum that can swing 360 degrees. The
 * pendulum is actuated by applying a torque on its pivot point. The goal is to
 * get the pendulum to balance up-right from its resting position (hanging down
 * at the bottom with no velocity) and maintain it as long as possible. The
 * pendulum can move freely, subject only to gravity and the action applied by
 * the agent.
 *
 * The state is 2-dimensional, the current angle (measured from the vertical
 * upright position) in the interval [-pi, pi] and current angular velocity in
 * the interval [-2pi, 2pi]. The angular velocity is constrained in order to
 * avoid damaging the pendulum system. If the angular velocity reaches this
 * limit during simulation, the pendulum is reset to the resting position. The
 * action is the angular acceleration, with discrete values {-1, 0, 1} applied
 * to the pendulum. For more details on environment dynamics refer to the
 * original paper, Santamar√≠a et al. (1998).
 *
 * The goal is to swing-up the pendulum and maintain its upright angle. The
 * reward is the negative absolute angle from the vertical position. Since the
 * goal is to reach and maintain a vertical position, this is a continuing task.
 * The action in this pendulum environment is not strong enough to move the
 * pendulum directly to the desired position. The agent must learn to first
 * move the pendulum away from its desired position and gain enough momentum to
 * successfully swing-up the pendulum. And even after reaching the upright
 * position the agent must learn to continually balance the pendulum in this
 * unstable position."
